# Pricing

We offer various pricing plans based on the volume you're expecting. 

---

### Pricing has three components:
1. **Set-up fee:** One-time cost that covers configuration and support of the white label implementation.
2. **Monthly fee:** Don't pay until your application is live. This fee is waived once you reach $1,000 in logo sales per month.
3. **Revenue share:** In addition, earn a percentage of every logo sold. This starts at 25% and increases as you scale. Top partners earn upwards of $3,000/month.

## Startup Package
For companies just starting out or who expect to sell less than 100 logos/month.
