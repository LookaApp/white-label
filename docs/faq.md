    <p>Please review our <a href="https://docs.looka.com/technical.html">Technical Documentation</a> and see if you can test out the white-label logo maker on your website or app. Also, please review our <a href="https://docs.looka.com/pricing.html">Pricing</a> to see which plan makes the most sense for you.</p>

    <p>Once you’re ready to go, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:partnerships@looka.com">partnerships@looka.com</a> so we can chat about your pricing plan. We’ll send over a white-label agreement for you to sign.</p>

    <p>From there, our team will work with you to configure the white-label on your site and we’ll also set-up billing.</p>
