# Frequently Asked Questions

---

<details>
    <summary>What’s the process for getting a partnership started?</summary>

    Please review our Technical Documentation and see if you can test out the white-label logo maker on your website or app. Also, please review our Pricing to see which plan makes the most sense for you. 

    Once you’re ready to go, reach out to us at partnerships@looka.com so we can chat about your pricing plan. We’ll send over a white-label agreement for you to sign.

    From there, our team will work with you to configure the white-label on your site and we’ll also set-up billing.

    Once that’s all done, you’re all set to launch your new logo maker!
